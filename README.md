### About Me 💡

I enjoy helping teams stay organized and utilizing technology to support smooth and efficient operations. I currently work at **Penguin Coding School**, where I manage daily operations while also teaching Python, JavaScript, and STEM concepts to students.

My role combines coordination and instruction! From scheduling and resource planning to designing engaging coding lessons and coaching students in robotics competitions. I focus on keeping programs running smoothly while making technical concepts approachable and practical.

In college, I’ve explored systems analysis, databases, networking, and project planning. I’m especially drawn to structured workflows, clear communication, and roles that bridge technical work with people and process management.
